# Insight-Project
# Project Idea

My system is a real-time monitoring system of the patient's ECG data and alerting system for the hospital.

# Business Value 

In the U.S. alone, yearly spending on healthcare can be as high as 980 billion. One costly part of healthcare services is the monitoring of the patientâ€™s vital signs and physiological signals. Medical facilities has their own monitoring equipment that can treat patients who go to these facilities. However, in-home care is believed to be one of the most effective ways for addressing increasingly severe chronic diseases. My project is a POC of a real-time ECG streaming system for hospitals to monitor at-home patients and their vital signs. The aim of this project is to processes massive amount of real-time, critical data with low latency.  

# Teck Stack
S3 to store the simulated data\
Kafka and Spark Streaming to load and process data \
Cassedra to store the results for further analysis and alert Paramedics \
Flask to present result in a dashboard
# Data Source
https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/cves/
100 GB in size.

# Engineering Challange
1. low lantency when alerting
2. Map the result to the appropriete paramedic's location
# MVP
1. A working pipeline and dashboard with 1GB of data
